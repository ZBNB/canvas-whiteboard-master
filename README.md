# Canvas whiteboard
This is an example of canvas accessible (and editable) by multiple users.

This time I wanted to learn something about sockets, namely [Socket.Io](http://socket.io) framework,
hence I did the backend using it together with Express.

## Running
If you (for some reason) want to run this, make sure you have Node installed. Then:
* Clone this repo with `git clone`
* Run `npm install` from project's root
* Once npm finishes, run `node app.js`
* Open your browser, go to `http://localhost:3210`, and you shall see the whiteboard.
Try opening several tabs pointing to that address, draw, and see what happens.

Have fun!
